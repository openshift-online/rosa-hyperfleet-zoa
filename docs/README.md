## Documentation Philosophy

Implementation-level architecture docs live **in this repo** (`docs/architecture/`) because they describe decisions specific to ZOA's code and are maintained by the same team that changes the code. This ensures docs stay in sync with the implementation.

Cross-system design proposals (how ZOA fits into the broader platform) live in the [rosa-hyperfleet](https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet) repo as ADRs. These are referenced below for historical context but are not the source of truth for implementation details.
